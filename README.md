## Analyst Track Abstract

#### Introduction

Understanding how teams organise collectively on the pitch is a common challenge
in football analysis. Concepts such as compactness, width or block height are
widely used in practice, but they are often discussed through isolated moments of
the game. Using tracking data, this project explores a simple and reproducible
way of describing collective team shape within a single match.

Rather than aiming to define a complete tactical model, the objective is to show
how basic geometrical metrics derived from player and ball positions can help
illustrate how a team’s spatial organisation varies depending on possession state
and attacking context.

#### Use case(s)

This project is intended as an exploratory tool for team shape analysis using
tracking data. The main use case is the descriptive analysis of a team’s
collective spatial organisation during a match, focusing on how geometrical
metrics such as width, depth and compactness change across possession states and
attacking phases.

From a practical analysis perspective, the methodology can help to:

- Compare team shape in and out of possession.
- Observe how a team expands or contracts in different attacking situations.
- Support post-match discussions with simple, data-driven visual summaries of
  team structure.

The same approach can also be reused for basic opposition analysis, allowing
analysts to compare team shape profiles across matches or teams in a consistent
way.

#### Potential Audience

This work is aimed at analysts, coaches and data practitioners interested in
working with tracking data at a team level. The methodology is intentionally kept
simple and transparent, making it suitable for exploratory analysis, teaching
purposes or as a starting point for more advanced team shape studies. The modular
structure of the code also allows others to adapt or extend the analysis to
different teams, matches or competitions.
