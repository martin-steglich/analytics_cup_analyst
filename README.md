## Analyst Track Abstract
#### Introduction

Understanding how teams organise collectively on the pitch is a key challenge
in modern football analysis. While tactical concepts such as compactness,
width or block height are widely used by practitioners, they are often described
qualitatively or through isolated snapshots. Using tracking data from the
SkillCorner Open Data set, this project proposes a structured and reproducible
approach to quantify and visualise collective team shape across different
contexts within a single match. The objective is to illustrate how a team’s
spatial organisation changes depending on possession state and attacking phase,
using geometrical metrics derived directly from player and ball positions.

#### Use case(s)

This project is designed as a practical tool to support team shape analysis
using tracking data. A primary use case is the descriptive analysis of a team’s
collective spatial organisation during a match, allowing analysts to quantify
how width, depth and compactness vary across possession states and attacking
contexts.

From a coaching and performance analysis perspective, the methodology can be
used to:
- Compare team shape behaviour in and out of possession.
- Identify tendencies in how a team expands or contracts depending on ball
  location and phase of play.
- Support post-match reviews by providing objective, reproducible visual
  summaries of team structure.

Additionally, the framework can be applied in an opposition analysis context,
where analysts may compare shape profiles across matches or teams to highlight
structural differences without relying on subjective interpretations.

#### Potential Audience

This work is intended for performance analysts, coaches and data scientists
working in professional or semi-professional football environments. The
methodology can support opposition analysis, self-analysis and tactical
profiling by providing a clear and interpretable framework to describe team
shape dynamics. In addition, the open and modular structure of the codebase
makes it suitable for analysts interested in extending team shape analysis to
other competitions, teams or contextual dimensions.
